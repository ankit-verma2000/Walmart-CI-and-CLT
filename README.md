# Walmart

# About:

Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores in the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.


# Business Problem:

The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).
