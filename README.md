# Walmart

# About:

Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores in the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.


# Business Problem:

The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against the customer’s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).
